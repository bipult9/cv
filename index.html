                <p>(Java, JavaScript, CPP, python)</p>
                <p>When I started my college degree program, the first thing I learned C programming language, and after that I use CPP for object oriented programming. While making projects I learn python, JavaScript and some front-end and back-end framework.
                    I also learn Java during my course.

            <h3>Face Mask Detection</h3>
            <img class="face-mask-img" src="face-mask-2.png" alt="face-mask-img">
            <p>This project is about face mask detection using webcam. In this project we use machine learning concept.Face Mask Detection System built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face
                masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align:left;">Motivation</h3>
            <p>Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises
                to ensure safety. The absence of large datasets of 'with_mask' images has made this task cumbersome and challenging.</p>
